First pass:
We set the sessionId on the Channel when invitee accepts invite and sets Channel slot
We query our server for otSessionId and otToken before we create the Channel
My worry is that this will slow down setting the Channel...Maybe it's unwarranted?
This is probably an indication that we should create a SetChannelSlotService...or just create a fn in FBM

How do we make sure tokens are always valid? Perhaps we create the NEXT token once the User is already connected?
Hmmm...this might disconnect the User as it would invalidate the prev token

Let's just try it the simple way: query the server for the token each time we power on
